# JS to-do list
### A console-based to-do list
Coded for the to-do list project in [The Web Development Bootcamp 2021 by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

There's two parts of this project:
1. **201** - The intro to the project, where Colt suggest we do the project by ourselves.
2. **202** - The code-along, where he basically codes the entire project and you follow along.

This repository is the first part, it is **my own attempt** to code the to-do list without watching the code-along.
